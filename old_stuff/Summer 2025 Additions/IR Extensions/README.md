The following code for "controllers" is for ESP32s associated with the output extension. This allows for communication with the Splat companions. The ssd1306 is the screen used for the decoder. 

# Robot
- Summer 2025 Additions/IR Extensions/IRcontrollerRobot.py - this is the transmitter code for the toy robot
- Summer 2025 Additions/IR Extensions/IRdecoderRobot.py - this is for decoding the IR protocol (a standard) for IR controlled lights (unlikely to be used for other devices)

# Traffic Light
- Summer 2025 Additions/IR Extensions/IRcontrollerTL.py - this is the transmitter code for the toy traffic light
- Summer 2025 Additions/IR Extensions/IRdecoderTL.py - this is for decoding the IR protocol (a standard) for IR controlled lights
