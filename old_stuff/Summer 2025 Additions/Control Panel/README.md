- Not tested with the latest version of Light or Motion Extensions.

- Follow Notion link (https://fetlab.notion.site/Playground-Using-the-Control-Panel-21fdf3d0e05280f4b687dc748732b64a) for compatible code versions from "Playground - Using Control Panel" Hackathon

- Future Improvements: The Control Panel currently sends config to all nearby esps, "fakes pairing" by showing the color of the nearest but the config can overwrite/be picked up by multiple esp32s if they are all somewhat close. Fix pairing behavior for targeted config and control operation. 
- Replace proximity detection with RFID/NFC
